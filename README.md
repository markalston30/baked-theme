## About Starter
Starter is a project by Calvin Koepke, a frontend designer currently working at Rainmaker Digital.
The goal of the project is to create a starter theme for Genesis Framework developers that doesn't over-bloat
their starting base, while including commonly used templates, codes, and styles, and which includes common Gulp development tasks.
